# Module-1-Challenge
Challenge assignment completed for Module 1

## Overview of Project
Analysis was completed to provide Louise with a clearer picture of how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.
In the first part of our analysis, outcomes for the theater campaigns were provided by launch date.  The possible outcomes were successful, canceled and failed.
The second part of the anaysis provided the outcome for plays based on funding goals.  Again, the variables used for the outcomes were successful, canceled and failed.

### Analysis and Challenges

* Deliverable 1

  * The pivot table clearly breaks down the data.  It was easy to change the parent category to theatre.  The number of canceled, failed and successful campaigns are clear.  However, even though the data is very concise, creating the line chart provides a more quickly discernible outcome, as it shows less clutter.  It still provides exact data if you hover over data points in the chart.

  * I encountered a couple of challenges.  When comparing my pivot chart to the example provided, I noted some differences in my numbers.  I discovered I had filters on, so I deleted my first pivot table, cleared the filters from the Kickstarter worksheet and started over.  Next, when completing the line chart I noticed the lines were not space properly.  I toggled through the different charts and found the correct line chart, making the data in the chart much easier to read.

* Deliverable 2
  
  * Like deliverable 1, deliverable 2 clearly breaks down the data.  Deliverable 2 still breaks down the campaigns by canceled, failed and successful, however in this example it uses the monetary goal instead of the launch date.  Also, the line chart in this example made it easier to determine factors, as there's less data to take in.

  * When completing the countifs() on worksheet, I ran into some errors when trying to copy and past the formula, in addition to needing to remove filters from the Kickstarter sheet again.  I used the Kickstarter sheet to check my data several times, and was able to detemine where I made mistakes.  The process on the Outcomes Based on Goals worksheet with a little more time comsuming.  I was also initally confused when reading the instructions.



#### Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

  * Launch dates from May-June appear to have more successes.

  * The number of canceled campaigns seem to be fairly low no matter what month is chosen.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

  * The highest goal amounts appear to have the highest failer percentages.

  * There were no canceled plays, regardless of goal amount.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

  * There's only one subcategory used, so only a limited amount of results are shown.  

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

  * I think creating another pivot chart with more subcategories can provide a much larger picture.  However, I wonder if the amount of data would be to large.

  * Additionally, a bar graph may be a good way to show results for more subcategories.
